            <h2>Combining my Ambitions for effective business intelligence</h2>
            <p class='primary-text'>

                <!-- INCLUDE EXAMPLES OF DATA SCIENCE SOLUTION THAT SOLVED A BUSINESS problem -->

                <!-- INCLUDE EXAMPLE OF PYTHON BASED DASHBOARD SOLUTION TO SOLVE A PROBLEM -->

                I believe that the solutions required in order to deliver maximum business value through data and technology lies in the use of smart, end-to-end systems with an end goal of allowing key insights to be delivered to business leaders in an on-demand way.
                <br><br>
                Over the course of my career, the business solutions that I have delivered in order to solve data related problems in the oil and gas industry, the renewables industry and financial services industry have had a much more pronounced effect when flexbility over technologies has been permitted in conjunction with high quality datasets delivered through connected systems. I found this to be applicable whether the solution involves process automation, linear programming or more sophisticated algorithms involving machine learning. I have also experienced first hand how collaboration creates more effective solutions. Since minimising the diversity of different technologies in a project helps faciliate collaboration, I found technologies such as Python to be critical in my projects for sustainable, collaborative efforts due to its user-friendly syntax and powerful set of packages in order to solve general purpose tasks as well as advanced tasks involving machine learning, the latter which particularly excites me.
                <br><br>
                I consider myself an expert in technologies such as Alteryx and Tableau, yet my experience suggests these only work for specific use cases and generally lack the sophistication and business value required to address many business problems, which is in contrast to the solutions that I offer.
                Before I arrived at my current team, the value of Python was not apparent, nor was it used, yet it is now our core technology and I have had a leading part in demonstrating the flexibility and effectiveness of Python in delivering end-to-end analytics to meet our specific business problems.
                <br><br>
                My ambition is to help demonstrate and deliver effective solutions to clients using the visions I have listed above. This would preferably include only the use of open-sourced technologies, where applicable, combined with novel data science techniques. The prospect of achieving this excites me.
